UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This code implements the methods described in [(Dror et al., 2018)]:

**"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Testing Statistical Significance in Natural Language Processing."** Rotem Dror, Gili Baumer, Segev Shlomov and Roi Reichart. *In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL2018)*.

The implemented methods help researchers and engineers draw statistically sound conclusions about the difference in performance between two algorithms on a given dataset.
